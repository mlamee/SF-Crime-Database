San Francisco Crime Database project
I will use the city categorial crime database, extracted from the Kaggle webpage: https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime. 
Here, I show two figures related to the three sample crime categories. The first figure shows the locations of these crimes on top of the city map.
